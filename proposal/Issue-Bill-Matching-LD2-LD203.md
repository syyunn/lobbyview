1. LD-2 and LD-203 can be consolidated over the overlapping period

2. We can get which issue code(s) and which bill(s) has been designated to the 
lobbying firm to for/against from LD-2 (e.g. Animal and Agriculture during 2008 
2nd Quarter from Safari Club to Ogilvy)

3. Also, we can find which PAC(s) (iow, which recipient(s)(usually the legislator) 
get its money during those overlapping period of time.
-> Research point: Can we link the issue/bill to the recipient/PAC contributed? IOW, 
in case there exist mixed issues requested to the LobbyingFirm, can we figure out why/how the lobbying firm allocated resources? 

-> Itâ€™s about political portfolio constructing strategy/skills from the perspective of 
lobbying - which is basically leveraging the political-domain specific knowledges from its field experience.
